#Gulp Noob!  
  
##Getting started with gulp.   
**Automate tasks**   
* Transfer files from 'src' to 'build' folders  
* Initiate browser-sync  
* Watch files (.html, .css)  
* Auto reload browser   


##Requirements   
* Npm (Node)  
* Gulp   
* Bower   
* Browser-sync   


## Install 
You will need npm so go install: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 
  
Once you have that installed, the fun begins.   

**Create a directory**  
`mkdir gulp-noob`  

**Create the *package.json* file**   
`npm init`  
Just press enter all the way through, until you can input a command 

**Create the *bower.json* file**   
`bower init`  
Do the same as before, press enter until you can input a command.  

**Now install gulp**
`npm install gulp --save-dev`  

`--save-dev` installs the tool/s in your directory.  

**Install browser-sync**
`npm install browser-sync --save-dev`

### This is where the tutorial falls short. 
Now just download all my files and or clone the repo into the directory and you should be almost done.   
  
**Run the task*  
`gulp`  
You're done, for now :)  
  

*I'll finish the tutorial at a later times with more detail! This should get you started though :)*
